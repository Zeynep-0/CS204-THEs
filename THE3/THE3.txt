The aim of this Take Home Exam (THE) is to have you work with the queue data structure, class
design issues and operator overloading. You are asked to implement a simulation of a computer
network, where packets of data roam around different routers and try to reach their destination.

Sample Run:
Please enter the name of the file for routers:
routers0.txt
Please enter the name of the file for packets:
packets0.txt
Packets are displayed in the order they arrive in the terminal router, along with their router visit history:
PacketX: E, 1, 2, 5, T
PacketY: E, 1, 2, 5, T
PacketC: E, 4, 5, T
PacketD: E, 4, 5, T
PacketB: E, 1, 3, 4, 5, T
