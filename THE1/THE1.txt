The aim of this take-home exam (THE) is to recall CS201 material and practice on matrices (i.e.,
two dimensional vectors). You are asked to search for a list of words in a character matrix, just
like you would do with Sunday morning puzzles. When searching for a word, you will calculate a
score based on the existence/absence of that word in the matrix.

Sample Run:

Input:
5
HJRLDGKU
AOYDOOOO
TRYTRUOA
OEGEZCDN
MRYTABLE
1
ATOM

Output:
4

Explanation of the output:
5 represents the number of rows of the matrix, therefore it is
followed by 5 lines of input. Then, 1 represents the number of
words that will be searched for in the matrix, therefore it is
followed by 1 line of input.
The output (score) is 4, as follows:
‚óè The word ATOM is found vertically in the matrix as
highlighted in the cell on the left. So, as per rule number
1 for calculating the score, the score is increased by the
number of letters in the word ATOM. Thus, the final score
is 4 as shown in the output column.
